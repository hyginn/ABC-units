# This tutorial covers basic concepts of graph theory and analysis in R. Make
# sure you have pulled the latest version of the project from the GitHub
# repository.

# Let's explore some of the basic ideas of graph theory by starting with a small
# random graph.


# To begin let's write a little function that will create random "gene" names;
# there's no particular purpose to this other than to make our graphs look a
# little more "biological" ...
makeRandomGenenames <- function(N) {
  nam <- character()
  while (length(nam) < N) {
    a <- paste0(c(sample(LETTERS, 1), sample(letters, 2)),
                collapse="") # one uppercase, two lowercase letters
    n <- sample(1:9, 1)      # one number
    nam[length(nam) + 1] <- paste(a, n, sep="") # store in vector
    nam <- unique(nam)   # delete if this was a duplicate
  }
  return(nam)
}

N <- 20

# One way to represent graphs in a computer is as an "adjacency matrix". In this
# matrix, each row and each column represents a node, and the cell at the
# intersection of a row and column contains a value/TRUE if there is an edge,
# 0/FALSE otherwise.

# Let's create an adjacency matrix for our random graph: let's say a pair
# of nodes has probability p <- 0.09 to have an edge, and our graph is
# symmetric , i.e. it is an undirected graph, and it has neither self-edges,
# i.e. loops, nor multiple edges between the same nodes, i.e. it
# is a "simple" graph. We use the Nnames vector as node labels.

makeRandomAM <- function(nam, p = 0.1) {
  # Make a random adjacency matrix for a set of nodes with edge probability p
  # Parameters:
  #   nam: a character vector of unique node names.
  #   p:   probability that a random pair of nodes will have an edge.
  #
  # Value: an adjacency matrix for a simple, undirected graph
  #

  N <- length(nam)

  rownames(AM) <- nam

      if (runif(1) < p) {     # runif() creates uniform random numbers
                              # between 0 and 1. The expression is TRUE with
                              # probability p. Then, if it is TRUE ...
        AM[iRow, iCol] <- 1   # ... record an edge for the pair (iRow, iCol)
      }
    }
  }
  return(AM)

# Listing the matrix is not very informative - we should plot this graph. The
# standard package for work with graphs in r is "igraph::". We'll go into more
# details of the igraph:: package a bit later, for now we just use it to plot:

if (! requireNamespace("igraph", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("igraph")
}
# Package information:
#  library(help = igraph)       # basic information
#  browseVignettes("igraph")    # available vignettes
#  data(package = "igraph")     # available datasets

# igraph:: functions work on "graph objects" and there are several functions
# to create a graph object from input data. We can create an igraph-graph
# from the adjacency matrix we defined above - nothing really changes, we just
# convert our nodes and edges into a computationally convnient form.
myG <- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(myRandAM, mode = "undirected")

set.seed(112358)                       # set RNG seed for repeatable randomness
                                       # calculate layout coordinates
myGxy <- igraph::layout_with_graphopt(myG,

set.seed(NULL)                         # reset the RNG


# The igraph:: package adds its own function to the collection of plot()
# functions; R decides which plot function to use, based on the class
# of the object that we request to plot. This plot function has parameters
#   layout - the x,y coordinates of the nodes;
#   vertex.color - which I define to color by node-degree
#   vertex size - which I define to increase with node-degree
#   vertex.label - which I set to combine the names of the vertices of the
#                 graph - names(V(iG)) - with the node degree - degree(iG).
# See ?igraph.plotting for the complete list of parameters

# The simplest descriptors of a graph are the number of nodes, edges, and the
# degree-distribution. In our example, the number of nodes was given: N; the
# number of edges can easily be calculated from the adjacency matrix. In our
# matrix, we have entered 1 for every edge. Thus we simply sum over the matrix:
sum(myRandAM)

# Is that what you expect?

# What about the degree distribution? We can get that simply by summing over the
# rows and summing over the columns and adding the two vectors.

rowSums(myRandAM) + colSums(myRandAM) # check this against the plot!

# The function degree() gives the same values
igraph::degree(myG)

# Let's  plot the degree distribution in a histogram:
degG <- igraph::degree(myG)
brk <- seq(min(degG)-0.5, max(degG)+0.5, by=1)  # define histogram breaks
hist(degG, breaks=brk, col="#A5CCF5",
     xlim = c(-1,8), xaxt = "n",
     main = "Node degrees", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Number")  # plot histogram
axis(side = 1, at = 0:7)

# Note: I don't _have_ to define breaks, the hist() function usually does that
# quite well, automatically. But for this purpose I want the columns of the
# histogram to represent exactly one node-degree difference.

# A degree distribution is actually a very informative descriptor of graphs,
#  since it is very sensitive to the generating mechanism. For biological
# networks, that is one of the key questions we are interested in: how was the
# network formed? Asking about the mechanism - the way the interactions
# support function and shape the fitness landscape in which the cell evolves -
# connects our mathematical abstraction with biological insight.


# =    2  DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS  ================================================

# Let's simulate a few graphs that are a bit bigger to get a better sense of
# their degree distributions:
#

# ==   2.1  Random graph  ======================================================

# ... which shows us that this does NOT correspond to the single-slope linear
# relationship that we expect for a "scale-free" graph.

# ==   2.2  scale-free graph (Barabasi-Albert)  ================================

# What does one of those intriguing "scale-free" distributions look like? The
# iGraph:: package has a function to make random graphs according to the
# Barabasi-Albert model of scale-free graphs. It is: sample_pa(), where pa
# stands for "preferential attachment". Preferential attachment is _one_ type of
# process that will yield scale-free distributions.

# This is a very obviously different graph! Some biological networks have
# features that look like that - but in my experience the hub nodes are usually
# not that distinct. But then again, that really depends on the parameter
# "power". Play with the "power" parameter and get a sense for what difference
# this makes. Also: note that the graph has only a single component - no
# singletons.

# What's the degree distribution of this graph?

     main = "200 nodes in a preferential-attachment network")

# Sort-of linear, but many of the higher ranked nodes have a frequency of only
# one. That behaviour smooths out in larger graphs - let's try 100000 nodes:
#
N <- 10000
X <- igraph::sample_pa(N, power = 0.8, directed = FALSE)  # 100,000 nodes

# ==   2.3  Random geometric graph  ============================================

# Finally, let's simulate a random geometric graph and look at the degree
# distribution. Remember: these graphs have a high probability to have edges
# between nodes that are "close" together - an entirely biological notion.

# We'll randomly place our nodes in a box. Then we'll define the
# probability for two nodes to have an edge to be a function of their Euclidian
# distance in the box.

# Here is a function that makes an adjacency matrix for such graphs. iGraph::
# has a similar function, sample_grg(), which connects nodes that are closer
# than a cutoff, the function I give you below is a bit more interesting since
# it creates edges according to a probability that is determined by a
# generalized logistic function of the distance. This sigmoidal function gives
# a smooth cutoff and creates more "natural" graphs. Otherwise, the function is
# very similar to the random graph function, except that we output the
# "coordinates" of the nodes together with the adjacency matrix which we then
# use for the layout. list() FTW.

# Getting the parameters of a generalized logistic right takes a bit of

# =    3  A CLOSER LOOK AT THE igraph:: PACKAGE  ===============================


# ==   3.1  Basics  ============================================================

# The basic object of the igraph:: package is a graph object. Let's explore the
# first graph some more, the one we built with our random gene names:
summary(myG)

# This output means: this is an IGRAPH graph, with U = UN-directed edges
#  and N = named nodes, that has 20 nodes and 20 edges. For details, see
?igraph::print.igraph

mode(myG)
class(myG)

# This means an igraph:: graph object is a special list object; it is opaque in
# the sense that a user is never expected to modify its components directly, but
# through a variety of helper functions which the package provides. There are
# many ways to construct graphs - from adjacency matrices, as we have just done,
# from edge lists, or by producing random graphs according to a variety of
# recipes, called _games_ in this package.

# Two basic functions retrieve nodes "Vertices", and "Edges":
igraph::V(myG)
igraph::E(myG)

# additional properties can be retrieved from the Vertices ...
igraph::V(myG)$name


# As with many R objects, loading the package provides special functions that
# can be accessed via the same name as the basic R functions, for example:

print(myG)
plot(myG)  # this is the result of default plot parameters

# ... where plot() allows the usual flexibility of fine-tuning the plot. We
# first layout the node coordinates with the Fruchtermann-Reingold algorithm - a
# force-directed layout that applies an attractive potential along edges (which
# pulls nodes together) and a repulsive potential to nodes (so they don't
# overlap). Note the use of the degree() function to color and scale nodes and
# labels by degree and the use of the V() function to retrieve the vertex names.
# See ?plot.igraph for details."

# Plot with some customizing parameters
oPar <- par(mar= c(0, 0, 0, 0)) # Turn margins off

# igraph:: has a large number of graph-layout functions: see
# ?layout_  and try them all.


# ==   3.2  Components  ========================================================

# The function igrap::components() tells us whether there are components of the
# graph in which there is no path to other components.
igraph::components(myG)

# In the _membership_ vector, nodes are annotated with the index of the
# component they are part of. Sui7 is the only node of component 2, Cyj1 is in
# the third component etc. This is perhaps more clear if we sort by component
# index
sort(igraph::components(myG)$membership, decreasing = TRUE)

# Retrieving e.g. the members of the first component from the list can be done by subsetting:

(sel <- igraph::components(myG)$membership == 1)  # boolean vector ..
(c1 <- igraph::components(myG)$membership[sel])
names(c1)


# =    4  RANDOM GRAPHS AND GRAPH METRICS  =====================================


# Let's explore some of the more interesting, topological graph measures. We
# start by building a somewhat bigger graph. We aren't quite sure whether
# biological graphs are small-world, or random-geometric, or
# preferential-attachment ... but igraph:: has ways to simulate the basic ones
# (and we could easily simulate our own). Look at the following help pages:

?igraph::sample_gnm             # see also sample_gnp for the Erdös-Rényi models
?igraph::sample_smallworld      # for the Watts & Strogatz model
?igraph::sample_pa              # for the Barabasi-Albert model

# But note that there are many more sample_ functions. Check out the docs!

# Let's look at betweenness measures for our first graph. Here: the nodes again
# colored by degree. Degree centrality states: nodes of higher degree are
# considered to be more central. And that's also the way the force-directed
# layout drawas them, obviously.

# names. The we draw the diameter-path with a transparent, thick pink line:

# =    5  GRAPH CLUSTERING  ====================================================


# Clustering finds "communities" in graphs - and depending what the edges
# represent, these could be complexes, pathways, biological systems or similar.
# There are many graph-clustering algorithms. One approach with many attractive
# properties is the Map Equation, developed by Martin Rosvall. See:
# http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18216267 and htttp://www.mapequation.org

table(igraph::membership(myGRGclusters))  # how large are the clusters?

# The largest cluster has 48 members, the second largest has 25, etc.

# their cluster membership:

# first, make a vector with as many grey colors as we have communities ...
