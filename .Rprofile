Your PROFILE FILE does not exist. This problem must be fixed to continue.

  The code expects the file "./myScripts/.myProfile.R" to exist and to
  contain your correct eMail address and student number. Detailed
  instructions were given when you first ran the init() command.

  Try running init() again and follow the instructions. Reload youR RStudio
  session and start over with this file.

  If this does not fix the problem, ask for help.

errText[["noStudentNumber"]] <- '
Your STUDENT NUMBER has not been defined. This problem must be fixed to continue.

  The code expects the file "./myScripts/.myProfile.R" to exist and to
  contain your correct eMail address and student number. This file gets
  sourced when you start a new R-session, but since you see this error
  message there was a problem.

  Perhaps you need to restart your R-session. Try closing the RStudio
  project and reopening it from the File > Recent Projects menu.

  Perhaps there was a syntax error in your file. Then not all the
  instructions in the file are executed. Check the file: is your
  email perhpas not defined? Or did you type it without qwuoataion
  marks?

  Try fixing problems, and then restart R as described above.

  If none of this fixes the problem, ask for help.
